# Breed
Do you know the game 'Dragon Quest Monster' on the Game Boy Color ?
You could collect little Monsters like in Pokemon. But the best thing in this game, 
which make it so unique was the breeding technology. 
You were able to interbreed every monster with each other and the result was a unique monster
with characteristics of both parent monsters. I want that.
